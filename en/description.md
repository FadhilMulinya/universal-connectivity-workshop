# Universal Connectivity

Welcome to the Universal Connectivity Workshop! This hands-on workshop teaches you how to build peer-to-peer applications using rust-libp2p, the powerful networking stack for decentralized applications.

## What You'll Learn

Throughout this workshop, you'll build a complete universal connectivity application from scratch, learning:

- **libp2p Fundamentals**: Peer identity, transport layers, and protocol composition
- **Network Protocols**: TCP, QUIC, and WebRTC transports for different connectivity scenarios
- **Peer Discovery**: Using Kademlia DHT and identify protocols for automatic peer discovery
- **Group Communication**: Implementing chat functionality with gossipsub pub/sub messaging
- **NAT Traversal**: Overcoming network restrictions with relay servers and hole punching
- **Custom Protocols**: Building request-response protocols for file sharing
- **Production Readiness**: Creating a complete application with terminal UI and error handling

## Workshop Structure

The workshop consists of 12 progressive lessons with 5 interactive checkpoints where you'll connect to the instructor's server to demonstrate your progress. Each checkpoint includes prizes for the fastest participants!

### Checkpoints Overview

1. **Ping Connection** (Lesson 3): Connect to instructor's server and send ping
2. **Identify Protocol** (Lesson 5): Extract peer information from instructor's node
3. **Kademlia Discovery** (Lesson 7): Use DHT to discover instructor's address
4. **Chat Connection** (Lesson 8): Join instructor's chat room and send messages
5. **Final Application** (Lesson 12): Complete universal connectivity with all features

## Prerequisites

- **Rust Knowledge**: Familiarity with Rust syntax and basic async/await concepts
- **Networking Basics**: Understanding of IP addresses, ports, and basic networking
- **Development Environment**: Rust toolchain (rustc, cargo) installed and working

## Workshop Format

This is an interactive, instructor-led workshop designed for classroom settings. You'll work through exercises step-by-step, with:

- **Clear Learning Objectives**: Each lesson focuses on specific concepts and skills
- **Hands-on Exercises**: Practical coding challenges that build real functionality
- **Progressive Hints**: Multiple levels of help, from gentle nudges to complete solutions
- **Competitive Elements**: Timed checkpoints with prizes to maintain engagement
- **Collaborative Learning**: Opportunities to help peers and learn from each other

## Final Application

By the end of this workshop, you'll have built a complete universal connectivity application featuring:

- Multi-transport connectivity (TCP, QUIC, WebRTC)
- Automatic peer discovery via DHT
- Real-time group chat with gossipsub
- File sharing between peers
- NAT traversal capabilities
- Terminal-based user interface
- Production-ready error handling

Get ready to dive deep into the world of peer-to-peer networking with rust-libp2p!
